    critique:
      "SHA-256 hashing provides data integrity — proof a file hasn't changed — but it cannot provide data veracity. If a provider inputs a fake report, the math will perfectly notarize that lie.",
    responseTitle: "We Notarize Attestations, Not Truth",
    response:
      "Exactly like a legal notary. A notary doesn't verify the truthfulness of a document — they verify who signed it, when, and that it hasn't been altered. APEX's PSI Protocol does the same thing cryptographically: it creates an immutable, timestamped, signed record of what was attested. If the attestation is later proven fraudulent, the notarized record becomes evidence against the attester — not a shield for them. The ledger is the courtroom exhibit.",

    critiqueTitle: "ZKP vs. Article 14 Transparency",
    critique:
      "Zero-Knowledge Proofs create technical complexity. A ZKP 'pass/fail' receipt may satisfy a technical check but doesn't provide the traceability and interpretability that lawyers and regulators need under Article 14 (Human Oversight).",
    responseTitle: "ZKPs Protect Weights — The Ledger Is Fully Transparent",
    response:
      "The ZKP layer protects only proprietary model weights during verification — it proves compliance properties without exposing trade secrets. The Gallows Ledger itself is fully transparent: every commit hash, Merkle root, challenge, and proof is publicly auditable. Article 14 requires human oversight of the AI system's behavior — our ledger provides exactly that. The ZKP proves the math checked out; the ledger shows what was checked and when.",

    critiqueTitle: "The Standardization Deadlock",
    critique:
      "Submitting to the IETF is standard practice, but if the European Commission issues its own standardization requests (Art. 40) that differ from PSI, the protocol could become a 'Legacy Island.' Being first isn't the same as being mandated.",
    responseTitle: "First-Mover + MIT License = Anti-Fragile",
    response:
      "The PSI Protocol is MIT-licensed. If the EU mandates a different standard, PSI adapts — the math is portable. But being the first formally submitted cryptographic compliance protocol to IETF creates gravitational pull: standards committees reference existing work. The protocol's canonical JSON (RFC 8785), Ed25519 signatures, and Merkle trees use zero proprietary primitives. Any future EU standard will use the same building blocks — because there are no others.",

    critiqueTitle: "The Liability Trap of Decentralization",
    critique:
      "The EU AI Act places compliance burdens on specific 'AI providers' and 'importers.' Decentralized entities lack direct, legally-binding ways to handle impact assessments. If the Tribunal fails, there's no 'High-Risk Provider' to sue.",
    responseTitle: "ASF Is the Legal Entity — The Tribunal Is the Jury",
    response:
      "The APEX Standards Foundation (ASF) serves as the legal entity under Article 3(3) — a registered, accountable provider. The Open Global Tribunal doesn't replace legal liability; it adds a public verification layer on top of it. Think of it as a jury system: the court (ASF) holds liability, the jury (Tribunal auditors) provides independent verification. If a verdict is wrong, the court is still accountable. Decentralization of judgment ≠ decentralization of liability.",
